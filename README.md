# My gentoo overlay (stolen /j)
Repository with ebuilds that I use that probably won't be updated in a good while, or are only available as 9999.
I will also consider maintaining projects that aren't in any "official" repo/overlay.

# List of ebuilds

So far these are the ebuilds in this overlay, with the overlay they're from in the same format portage uses

```
dev-python/elevate::oiledmachine-repository
x11-apps/ocs-url-9999::rion
x11-misc/plank-reloaded-9999::nbsd      # this one!!!
```
